## Features

- **10,000 animated particles** forming complex, organic patterns
- **Dynamic color system** using HSB color mode for vibrant, shifting hues
- **Responsive design** that adapts to any window size
- **Smooth animations** with optimized performance
- **Mathematically-generated patterns** creating hypnotic visual effects

## How to Use

1. Simply open the HTML file in any modern web browser
2. The animation will automatically start and fill your browser window
3. Watch as the particles form ever-changing, colorful patterns

## Technical Details

- Built with [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) library
- Uses trigonometric functions to calculate particle positions
- Implements HSB (Hue, Saturation, Brightness) color mode for dynamic coloring
- Optimized rendering with `pixelDensity(1)` for consistent performance

## Customization

You can experiment with the code by modifying:

- The number of particles (change the `10000` value in the for loop)
- The color calculations in the `a()` function
- The movement patterns by adjusting the trigonometric functions
- The particle size (currently set to `1.5`)

## Requirements

- Any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Internet connection (for loading p5.js CDN)

Enjoy the hypnotic visual experience!
